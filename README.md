You should create a simple TODO list application with following requirements:

•         Code should be clean and readable

•         Based on ReactJS

•         Redux should be  used for managing application state

•         Redux-form should be used for adding/entering items (with validation)

•         Should be assembled with WebPack (minimized, finally there should be 3 files except images: index.html, bundle.js, bundle.css)

•         Should be Localized in 2 languages (English and any other) with i18next

 

•         Good-looking design is not needed

•         Authentication and etc. is not needed just create/edit/delete/complete todo’s

•         Server side code is not needed (application may lose data after refresh of a page)

•         Please provide which materials and tutorials you used when working on this task

 

As an example take a look on http://todolist.parseapp.com the only difference is that adding and editing of Todo Item MUST happen in a popup up dialog (not browse, HTML based).

Code and working example should be placed on GitHub (example as GitHub Pages).
